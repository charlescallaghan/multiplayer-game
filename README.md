## My git workflow

In this project I tried to use:

- Good commit messages
- Well named branches
- Pull requests with summaries

If you have feedback to improve my git usage: **[please drop me a line!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlescallaghan89/)** 

Here is my branching model for this project.

```
master (auto deploys) ______________________
                       \               /
development             \_____________/- pull request
                         \           /
feature/some-feature      \_commits_/- pull request
```

## My agile workflow and Trello board

We tried to use incremental development throughout this project. The idea was to have an MVP ready as soon as possible, and to then try to implement some extra features.
